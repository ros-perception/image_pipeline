image_pipeline
==============

[![Build Status](https://build.ros2.org/buildStatus/icon?job=Rdev__image_pipeline__ubuntu_jammy_amd64)](https://build.ros2.org/job/Rdev__image_pipeline__ubuntu_jammy_amd64/)

This package fills the gap between getting raw images from a camera driver and higher-level vision processing.

Documentation is hosted in the ROS 2 API docs.
The [image_pipeline](http://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/p/image_pipeline/)
documentation includes an overview,
[details on camera_info](http://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/p/image_pipeline/camera_info.html),
and links to the documentation for each individual package.

Not every aspect has been ported to the new ROS 2 API documentation yet, so
there is still additional (partially outdated) information
in [the ROS wiki entry](http://wiki.ros.org/image_pipeline).

If you are using an Nvidia Jetson platform, consider using modules from [Isaac Image Proc](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_image_pipeline) - a collection of hardware accelerated `image_proc` features for the Jetsons.
