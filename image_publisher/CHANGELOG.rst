Forthcoming
-----------

1.12.23 (2018-05-10)
--------------------
* fix 'VideoCapture' undefined symbol error (`#318 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/318>`_)
  * fix 'VideoCapture' undefined symbol error
  The following error occured when trying to run image_publisher:
  [...]/devel/lib/image_publisher/image_publisher: symbol lookup error: [...]/devel/lib//libimage_publisher.so: undefined symbol: _ZN2cv12VideoCaptureC1Ev
  Probably, changes in cv_bridge reducing the OpenCV component dependencies led to the error. See
  https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/commit/8b5bbcbc1ce65734dc600695487909e0c67c1033
  This is fixed by manually finding OpenCV with the required components and adding the dependencies to the library, not just the node.
  * add image_publisher opencv 2 compatibility

1.12.22 (2017-12-08)

1.12.21 (2017-11-05)
--------------------

1.12.20 (2017-04-30)
--------------------
* explicitly cast to std::vector<double> to make gcc6 happy
  With gcc6, compiling image_publisher fails with this error:
  ```
  /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp: In member function 'virtual void image_publisher::ImagePublisherNodelet::onInit()':
  /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp:180:43: error: ambiguous overload for 'operator=' (operand types are 'sensor_msgs::CameraInfo\_<std::allocator<void> >::_D_type {aka std::vector<double>}' and 'boost::assign_detail::generic_list<int>')
  camera_info\_.D = list_of(0)(0)(0)(0)(0);
  ```
  After adding an initial explicit type cast for the assignment,
  compiling fails further with:
  ```
  | /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp: In member function 'virtual void image_publisher::ImagePublisherNodelet::onInit()':
  | /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp:180:65: error: call of overloaded 'vector(boost::assign_detail::generic_list<int>&)' is ambiguous
  |      camera_info\_.D = std::vector<double> (list_of(0)(0)(0)(0)(0));
  ```
  Various sources on the internet [1, 2, 3] point to use the
  `convert_to_container` method; hence, this commit follows those
  suggestions and with that image_publisher compiles with gcc6.

* address gcc6 build error
  With gcc6, compiling fails with `stdlib.h: No such file or directory`,
  as including '-isystem /usr/include' breaks with gcc6, cf.,
  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70129.
  This commit addresses this issue for this package in the same way
  it was addressed in various other ROS packages. A list of related
