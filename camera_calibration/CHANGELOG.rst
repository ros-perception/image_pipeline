2.2.1 (2020-08-27)
------------------
* remove email blasts from steve macenski (`#596 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/596>`_)
* Add pytest.ini to fix warning (`#584 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/584>`_)
  Fixes the following warning:
  Warning: The 'junit_family' default value will change to 'xunit2' in pytest 6.0.
  Add 'junit_family=xunit1' to your pytest.ini file to keep the current format in future versions of pytest and silence this warning.
* [Foxy] Use ament_auto Macros (`#573 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/573>`_)
* Contributors: Jacob Perron, Joshua Whitley, Steve Macenski

2.2.0 (2020-07-27)
------------------
* Removed basestring (no longer exists in new python 3 version). (`#554 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/554>`_)
  Fixes `#551 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/551>`_
* Initial ROS2 commit.
* Contributors: Michael Carroll, PfeifferMicha

1.12.23 (2018-05-10)
--------------------
* camera_checker: Ensure cols + rows are in correct order (`#319 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/319>`_)
  Without this commit, specifying a smaller column than row size lead to
  huge reported errors:
  ```
  $ rosrun camera_calibration cameracheck.py --size 6x7 --square 0.0495
  Linearity RMS Error: 13.545 Pixels      Reprojection RMS Error: 22.766 Pixels
  $ rosrun camera_calibration cameracheck.py --size 7x6 --square 0.0495
  Linearity RMS Error: 0.092 Pixels      Reprojection RMS Error: 0.083 Pixels
  ```
  This commit switches columns and rows around if necessary.

1.12.22 (2017-12-08)
--------------------
* Changed flags CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR by IMREAD_COLOR to adapt to Opencv3. (`#252 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/252>`_)
* Fixed stereo calibration problem with chessboard with the same number of rows and cols by rotating the corners to same direction.
* Contributors: jbosch

1.12.21 (2017-11-05)
--------------------
* re-add the calibration nodes but now using the Python modules.
  Fixes `#298 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/298>`_
* Move nodes to Python module.
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud

1.12.20 (2017-04-30)
--------------------
* properly save bytes buffer as such
  This is useful for Python 3 and fixes `#256 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/256>`_.
* Get tests slightly looser.
  OpenCV 3.2 gives slightly different results apparently.
* Use floor division where necessary. (`#247 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/247>`_)
* Fix and Improve Camera Calibration Checker Node (`#254 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/254>`_)

  * Add approximate to cameracheck
* Force first corner off chessboard to be uppler left.
  Fixes `#140 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/140>`_
* fix doc jobs
  This is a proper fix for `#233 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/233>`_
* During stereo calibration check that the number of corners detected in the left and right images are the same. This fixes `ros-perception/image_pipeline#225 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/225>`_
* Contributors: Leonard Gerard, Martin Peris, Vincent Rabaud, hgaiser

1.12.19 (2016-07-24)
--------------------
* Fix array check in camerachecky.py
  This closes `#205 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/205>`_
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud

--------------------
* clean OpenCV dependency in package.xml
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud

1.12.15 (2016-01-17)
--------------------
* better 16 handling in mkgray
  This re-uses `#150 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/150>`_ and therefore closes `#150 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/150>`_
* fix OpenCV2 compatibility
* fix tests with OpenCV3
* [Calibrator]: add yaml file with calibration data in output
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud, sambrose

1.12.14 (2015-07-22)
--------------------
* remove camera_hammer and install Python nodes properly
  camera_hammer was just a test for camera info, nothing to do with
  calibration. Plus the test was basic.
* Correct three errors that prevented the node to work properly.
* Contributors: Filippo Basso, Vincent Rabaud

1.12.13 (2015-04-06)
--------------------
* replace Queue by deque of fixed size for simplicity
  That is a potential fix for `#112 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/112>`_
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud

1.12.12 (2014-12-31)
--------------------

1.12.11 (2014-10-26)
--------------------

1.12.10 (2014-09-28)
--------------------
* Update calibrator.py
  bugfix: stereo calibrator crashed after the signature of the method for the computation of the epipolar error changed but the function call was not updated
* Contributors: Volker Grabe

1.12.9 (2014-09-21)
-------------------
* fix bad Python
* only analyze the latest image
  fixes `#97 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/97>`_
* flips width and height during resize to give correct aspect ratio
* Contributors: Russell Toris, Vincent Rabaud

1.12.8 (2014-08-19)
-------------------
* install scripts in the local bin (they are now rosrun-able again)
  fixes `#93 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/93>`_
* fix default Constructor for OpenCV flags
  this does not change anything in practice as the flag is set by the node.
  It just fixes the test.
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud

1.12.6 (2014-07-27)
-------------------
* make sure the GUI is started in its processing thread and fix a typo
  This fully fixes `#85 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/85>`_
* fix bad call to save an image
* have display be in its own thread
  that could be a fix for `#85 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/85>`_
* fix bad usage of Numpy
  fixes `#89 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/89>`_
* fix asymmetric circle calibration
  fixes `#35 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/35>`_
* add more tests
* improve unittests to include all patterns
* install Python scripts properly
  and fixes `#86 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/86>`_
* fix typo that leads to segfault
  fixes `#84 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/84>`_
* also print self.report() on calibrate ... allows to use the params without having to commit them (e.g. for extrensic calibration between to cameras not used as stereo pair)
* fixes `#76 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/76>`_
  Move Python approximate time synchronizer to ros_comm
* remove all trace of cv in Python (use cv2)
* remove deprecated file (as mentioned in its help)
* fixes `#25 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/25>`_
  This is just removing deprecated options that were around since diamondback
* fixes `#74 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/74>`_
  calibrator.py is now using the cv2 only API when using cv_bridge.
  The API got changed too but it seems to only be used internally.
