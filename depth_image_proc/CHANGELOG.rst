Changelog for package depth_image_proc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

5.0.1 (2024-03-26)
------------------
* Update depth_image_proc::RegisterNode documentation (`#957 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/957>`_)
  Adding missing parameters from register node of depth_image_proc
  package.
  Related to Issue `#956 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/956>`_
* add invalid_depth param (`#943 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/943>`_)
  Add option to set all invalid depth pixels to a specified value, typically the maximum range.
  * Updates convertDepth parameter name and optimizes use of the parameter.
  * Updates PointCloudXYZ, PointCloudXYZI, and PointCloudXYZRGB with new invalid_depth parameter
* fix image publisher remapping (`#941 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/941>`_)
  Addresses `#940 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/940>`_ - fixes the compressed/etc topic remapping for publishers
* unified changelog, add missing image, deduplicate tutorials (`#938 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/938>`_)
  Last bit of documentation updates - putting together a single changelog
  summary for the whole release (rather than scattering among packages).
  Unified the camera_info tutorial so it isn't duplicated. Added a missing
  image from image_rotate (was on local disk, but hadn't committed it)
* migrate image_pipeline docs (`#929 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/929>`_)
  * Migrates image_pipeline overview page
  * Migrates CameraInfo wiki page
  * Adds links to the other packages in this stack
  * Updates depth_image_proc and image_proc to have the overview page properly named and in the TOC
* migrate depth_image_proc docs (`#926 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/926>`_)
* Fixed image types in depth_image_proc
* Contributors: Alejandro Hernández Cordero, Alessio Parmeggiani, Michael Ferguson, philipp.polterauer

5.0.0 (2024-01-24)
------------------
* radial nodes: should all sub to raw topics (`#906 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/906>`_)
  Per findings in
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/388#issuecomment-1902487162
  - instead of renaming xyz_radial and xyzi_radial to image_rect, I should
  have made the xyzrgb_radial use image_raw (since these nodes use
  matrices K & D):
  * Revert the change in xyzi_radial - topic is depth/image_raw as it has
  always been
  * Revert the change in xyz_radial, although it is still changed slightly
  from the old "image_raw" -> "depth/image_raw" for consistency with the
  other nodes.
  * Update xyzrgb_radial:
  * depth_registered/image_rect -> depth/image_raw
  * rgb/image_rect_color -> rgb/image_raw
  * update launch files accordingly (and remove camera_info since it no
  longer needs to be renamed, happens automagically). Note: these launch
  files are probably epically bad since realsense doesn't output radial
  images... but we'll leave them as documentation for these nodes.
* depth_image_proc: update launch files (`#905 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/905>`_)
  * follow up to `#900 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/900>`_ - had not noticed these launch files at the time
  * remove camera_info topics that auto remap now
* depth_image_proc: consistent image_transport (`#900 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/900>`_)
  * all node support image_transport and/or depth_image_transport parameters.
  * point cloud nodes use depth_image_transport parameter for all depth inputs
  * fixes so that remapping works appropriately for image topics, even when using transports other than raw
  * fixes so that remapping works appropriately for image_transport outputs (crop/convert nodes)
  * support remapping camera_info topics
* support rgba8 and bgra8 encodings by skipping alpha channel (`#869 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/869>`_)
  Related with the change in ROS 1
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/pull/671/files
  ---------
* ROS 2: Add option to use the RGB image timestamp for the registered depth image (`#872 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/872>`_)
  Related with this PR in ROS 1
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/pull/871
* Support MONO16 image encodings: point_cloud_xyz (`#868 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/868>`_)
  Related with this change in ROS 1
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/pull/630
* ROS 2: depth_image_proc/point_cloud_xyzi_radial Add intensity conversion (copy) for float (`#867 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/867>`_)
  Ported from ROS 1
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/pull/336/files
* make remaining components lazy (`#853 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/853>`_)
  missed a few components in `#815 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/815>`_
* allow use as component or node (`#852 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/852>`_)
  This addresses
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/823:
  * depth_image_proc was never implemented properly this way
  * image_proc might have once worked this way, but it appears upstream
  has changed over time and it was no longer doing the job.
  * stereo_image_proc is actually implemented correctly - I just added a
  comment

  This implements `#780 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/780>`_ for ROS 2 distributions after Iron, where we have:
  * Connect/disconnect callbacks, per https://github.com/ros2/rmw/issues/330 (this made it into Iron)
  * Updated APIs in https://github.com/ros-perception/image_common/pull/272 (this is only in Rolling currently)

* Updated depth_image_proc for ros2
  Instantiated template for convertDepth, added options to register, and
  changed register from a class loader to an RCLPP component.

  I noticed that these are listed in CMakeLists.txt but not in package.xml
  and this is causing a build failure for the binary releases on
  build.ros2.org:

2.2.0 (2020-07-27)
------------------
* Replacing deprecated header includes with new HPP versions. (`#566 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/566>`_)
  * Replacing deprecated header includes with new HPP versions.
  * CI: Switching to official Foxy Docker container.
  * Fixing headers which don't work correctly.
* Contributors: Joshua Whitley

* make parameters work in depth_image_proc (`#544 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/544>`_)

  * update depth_image_proc components
  This makes them loadable with the rclcpp_components
  interface. I've fully tested PointCloudXYZRGB and
  ConvertMetric, my use case doesn't use the others.
  I also lack a setup to test the launch files fully,
  but ran them with the realsense commented out and
  they appear to be OK.

-------------------
* Add point_cloud_xyzi nodelet
  This is for cameras that output depth and intensity images.
  It's based on the point_cloud_xyzrgb nodelet.

  `libdepth_image_proc` is missing this dependency at runtime
  ```
  > ldd libdepth_image_proc.so  | grep eigen
  libeigen_conversions.so => not found
  ```
  Which causes the following error on loading depth_image_proc:
  ```
