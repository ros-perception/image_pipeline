* Port depth image proc on ROS2 (`#362 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/362>`_)
* Initial ROS2 commit.
* Contributors: Chris Ye, Michael Carroll

2.2.1 (2020-08-27)
------------------
* remove email blasts from steve macenski (`#596 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/596>`_)
* [Foxy] Use ament_auto Macros (`#573 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/573>`_)
  * Fixing version and maintainer problems in camera_calibration.
  * Applying ament_auto macros to depth_image_proc.
  * Cleaning up package.xml in image_pipeline.
  * Applying ament_auto macros to image_proc.
  * Applying ament_auto macros to image_publisher.
  * Applying ament_auto macros to image_rotate.
  * Applying ament_auto macros to image_view.
  * Replacing some deprecated headers in image_view.
  * Fixing some build warnings in image_view.
  * Applying ament_auto macros to stereo_image_proc.
  * Adding some linter tests to image_pipeline.
  * Updating package URLs to point to ROS Index.
* Add rclcpp and rclcpp_components dependencies to package.xml. (`#569 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/569>`_) (`#570 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/570>`_)
  I noticed that these are listed in CMakeLists.txt but not in package.xml
  and this is causing a build failure for the binary releases on
  build.ros2.org:

2.2.0 (2020-07-27)
------------------
* Replacing deprecated header includes with new HPP versions. (`#566 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/566>`_)
  * Replacing deprecated header includes with new HPP versions.
  * CI: Switching to official Foxy Docker container.
  * Fixing headers which don't work correctly.
* Contributors: Joshua Whitley

* make parameters work in depth_image_proc (`#544 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/544>`_)
* update depth_image_proc components (`#543 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/543>`_)
  * update depth_image_proc components
  This makes them loadable with the rclcpp_components
  interface. I've fully tested PointCloudXYZRGB and
  ConvertMetric, my use case doesn't use the others.
  I also lack a setup to test the launch files fully,
  but ran them with the realsense commented out and
  they appear to be OK.
  * fix linting

1.12.20 (2017-04-30)
--------------------
* Fix CMake warnings about Eigen.
* Convert depth image metric from [m] to [mm]
* address gcc6 build error
  With gcc6, compiling fails with `stdlib.h: No such file or directory`,
  as including '-isystem /usr/include' breaks with gcc6, cf.,
  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70129.

1.12.6 (2014-07-27)
-------------------
* Add point_cloud_xyzi nodelet
  This is for cameras that output depth and intensity images.
  It's based on the point_cloud_xyzrgb nodelet.
* Missing runtime dependency - eigen_conversions
  `libdepth_image_proc` is missing this dependency at runtime
  ```
  > ldd libdepth_image_proc.so  | grep eigen
  libeigen_conversions.so => not found
  ```
  Which causes the following error on loading depth_image_proc:
  ```
