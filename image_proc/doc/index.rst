Overview
========

This package contains a number of ROS 2 components and nodes for image processing.

An example of what ``image_proc`` components can do is taking an original
camera image, which is Bayered and distorted, and transforming it into a
rectified image, de-Bayered and undistorted (amount of black border may
vary depending on calibration):

|raw| |color|

.. |raw| image:: images/left_raw.png
   :width: 49%

.. |color| image:: images/left_rect_color.png
   :width: 49%

The images above were produced using the tutorial :ref:`Using image_proc Launch File`.
