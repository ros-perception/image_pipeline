Overview
========

This package contains a number of ROS 2 components, nodes, and launch files
for stereo image processing.

If porting from ROS 1, please note that the ``stereo_image_proc`` node no
longer exists and instead you should use ``stereo_image_proc.launch.py``.
See the :ref:`Configuration` page for more detail.

``DisparityNode`` can compute disparity images from incoming stereo
pairs using
`OpenCV's block matching <https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html#stereobm>`_
algorithm. These are best inspected
using ``stereo_view`` which is available in the ``image_view`` package.

``PointCloudNode`` can produce point clouds, which you can view in ``rviz``,
and process with PCL.

The image below shows the **left/image_raw** and **right_image_raw**.
These are the raw images from each camera.

|raw|

.. |raw| image:: images/raw.png

Below are the **left/image_rect_color** and **right/image_rect_color**.
These are the rectified images from each camera.
The red lines show that the same point in the real world
lies on the same horizontal line in each rectified image.

|rectified|

.. |rectified| image:: images/rectified.png

The resulting disparity image is shown below,
viewed with ``stereo_view`` from the ``image_view`` package.
